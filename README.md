> **Go from a CVE number to the exact patched code and its vulnerability analysis**

## Overview
PatchLeaks compares two versions of a code‑base, highlights lines changed by vendor, and explains *why* they matter. Feed the tool an old and a patched version; PatchLeaks spots the security fix and provides detailed description so you can validate—or weaponize—it fast.

## Why PatchLeaks?
| **Real-World Challenge** | **Old-School Pain** | **PatchLeaks Fix** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Hundreds of files change every release | Manual grepping / fragile regex rules | Context‑aware diff analysis that ranks security‑relevant changes first |
| Patches include both old and new code | Most SASTs refuse to scan incomplete code | Tolerates mixed old/new hunks and still reasons about vulnerable flows |
| Logic bugs (ACL, privilege escalation…) | Almost always missed | Language‑model reasoning surfaces non‑trivial logic flaws |
| 0-day triage under the gun | Hours•days of eyeballing | **Minutes** to first actionable insight |

## Key Features
- **Folder Analysis** — Compare any two local directories  
- **Product Analysis** — Use public GitHub repository directly; PatchLeaks fetches, compares, and reports.
- **CVE Mode** — Paste a CVE ID, choose affected version with patched version, and let the engine spot the patch
- **Keyword Scoping** — Limit attention to particular file extensions
- **Reports** — Save, reopen, and share analyses; every run is reproducible.
- **Pluggable Back-Ends** — Works with both self and cloud hosted AI models.
